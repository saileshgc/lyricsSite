               <p>I don't love you but I want to<br/>
Just give me something that I cant hold on to<br/>
Come on baby and speed your lust to me<br/>
Here's my number on a cocktail napkin<br/>
Think about it like a loaded weapon<br/>
Cock the hammer and point that thing at me<br/> <br/>

[Chorus:]
Why don't you call [3x]<br/>
Kill me for the thrill of it all<br/><br/> 

I want someone anyone<br/>
Tall ones short ones skinny ones<br/>
I want someone anyone <br/><br/>

You spend your nights at home crying<br/>
I spend mine death defying<br/>
I call it testing morality<br/>
So pull the goggles down over your eyes<br/>
Say good night to the rest of the barflies<br/>
I'm forever yours temporarily <br/><br/>

[Repeat Chorus]<br/><br/>

I want someone anyone<br/>
Drunk ones spun ones anyone<br/>
I want someone anyone <br/><br/>

Fat ones whacked ones give me some<br/>
I want someone anyone<br/>
Spend some rent one lend me one<br/>
Fun ones dumb ones gypsy chicks on rocks<br/>
Done ones even chicks with chicken pox <br/><br/>

I want someone anyone [4x]<br/>
Drunk ones spun ones give me some<br/>
I want someone anyone<br/>
Fat ones whacked ones anyone<br/>
I want someone anyone<br/><br/>
